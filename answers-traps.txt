1. a0-a7; a2
2. There is none. g(x) is inlined within f(x) and f(x) is further inlined into main().
3. 0x0000000000000630, main calls it with pc-relative addressing.
4. 0x0000000000000038, next line of assembly right after the jalr.
5. He110 World; 0x726c6400; No, because 57616 = 0xe110 regardless of endianness.
6. A random value depending on what codes there are right before the call.Because printf tried to read more arguments than supplied. The second argument `3` is passed in a1, and the register for the third argument, a2, is not set to any specific value before the call, and contains whatever there is before the call.
